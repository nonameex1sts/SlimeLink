Idea: Based on Sleeping Block - a top 20 game of GameJam 2021 (https://davifox.itch.io/sleepy-blocks).
- Genre: Puzzle game.
- Controls: WASD or arrow keys.

Description:
- The character moves on a grid-based map. The character has two states: active (controllable) and inactive (non-controllable).
- The inactive character becomes activated when the active character gets close. When controlling, all active characters will move together.
- Objective: Move the characters to the destination with the fewest moves. All active characters must be in the destination cell, and all destination cells must contain an active character to win.
- Obstacles: Walls that restrict movement, mechanisms for increasing or decreasing the number of character blocks, and enemies blocking the path.
